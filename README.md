# AgeFileDecryption
A brief program that decrypts age files

This Python program has the ability to decrypt AgeFiles. In practice, it's quite challenging to use, as translating from an actual AgeFile to an AgeFile object is tedious. I will try to reconfigure to make it more useable. 

This was part of Will Shand's CS3710 (Intro to Cybersecurity) PA#2, and some of the code included is from the basis of that assignment.
